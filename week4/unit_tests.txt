To get the ball rolling:

1.3.3 vectorized logistic regression
[c g] = lrCostFunction([0.6 0.3 0.2]',[1.1 0.1 1;1.5 1.3 2],[1 1]',2)
c =  0.32170
g =
  -0.27694
   0.18419
  -0.10133

If you get stuck, we can post more. Don't want to rob you of the learning experience though.

Note: The parameters for a unit test are purely mechanical and have nothing to to with the assignment, deliberately.

Update (T. Mosher) - adding more validated test cases to this post so they stay pinned to the top of the thread ----
---------------------------------------
Non-regularized version of lrCostFunction() (per section 1.3.2)
(set lambda to zero in the above test)
results:
c = 0.25670
g = 
  -0.27694
  -0.11581
  -0.30133
--------------------------------------
another Regularized lrCostFunction() (with both y values set to zero)
theta = [0.6 ; 0.3 ; 0.2]
X = [1.1 0.1 1.0 ; 1.5 1.3 2.0];
y = [0 ; 0]
[c g] = lrCostFunction(theta, X, y, 0.1)
c = 1.5499
g = 
  1.02306
  0.59919
  1.20867
-----------------------------------
[Update: added 2014-04-09]
Here is a simple unit test for predictOneVsAll();
all_theta = [-0.7 0.5 -0.3 0.3;-0.7 -0.3 0.5 0.3;-0.7 -0.3 -0.3 -0.5];
X = [1 0 0;0 1 0;0 0 -1];
p = predictOneVsAll(all_theta, X)
p = 
  1

This test is pending until someone verifies it.
