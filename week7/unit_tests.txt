Assignment #2 [dataset3Params]
% With C & sigma vectors defined as below:
% C_vect = [0.01; 1; 3];
% sigma_vect = [0.01; 1; 3];

% I have modified the function to return matrix 'error_master', which basically has 
% the error corresponding to each combination of C and sigma...this can potentially help
% with code debugging. Also, I have reduced the number of C-sigma combinations to 
% reduce the execution time

Assignment #3 [processEmail]
>> word_indices = processEmail("Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI.")
